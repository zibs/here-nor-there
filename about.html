            <p>This podcast series began during a Media Arts Residency at the Western Front from April 2017-Oct 2017. I produce, host, write, edit, record and do graphic and sound design for Here nor There.</p>

            <p>When I first began the series, I knew that I wanted to maximize the potential of all the resources presented to me during my residency, and I knew I wanted to work with as many people as possible. The vehicle of conversation and collaboration made sense, and its form was a podcast series. Adjacent to the episodes is a sound-based event series entitled Slow-Wave, which has thus far taken place in the Western Front’s Grand Luxe Hall. </p>

            <p>The collection of interviews, hangouts, mixes, concerts, plays and sonic artworks are a part of an artistic project that largely attempts to embody one of my understandings of the act of listening, and I have asked my guests to reflect on this same thing, using their creative practices as pivot point for what we were going to make together. This project is additionally a response to a city that continually attempts to evaporate any form of positive deviancy, hijinx or solidarity through a variety of bureaucratic strategies— especially through the rapid decline of physical space to have our studios in, gather in, meet, organize, play, eat, sleep, live in. </p>
